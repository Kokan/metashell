  <p>
    The goal of this project is to provide an interactive template
    metaprogramming shell.

  <h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>

  <p>
    When one starts learning a new programming language such as Haskell, Python
    or Erlang an interactive shell (<code>python</code> for Python,
    <code>ghci</code> for Haskell, <code>erl</code> for Erlang) is available for
    experimenting with the language. Later, after getting familiar with the
    language, this shell becomes a tool to try code out, verify test results or
    learn more about the problem during debugging.
  </p>

  <p>
    When one starts learning C++ template metaprogramming, he has to use a C++
    compiler which was designed to <em>compile code</em> and not to play with
    template tricks. People new to template metaprogramming have to learn how to
    make the compiler show them the result of simple metaprograms. This makes it
    more difficult to get started with template metaprogramming.
  </p>

  <p>
    Later, after getting familiar with template metaprogramming, developers have
    to use the compiler for testing and debugging. Understanding what is going
    on in a template metaprogram during debugging is difficult, since the
    compiler needs to be forced to present the result of a metaprogram (or a
    part of it) - and compilers are not prepared for this. This extra difficulty
    in debugging makes simple problems look difficult.
  </p>

  <p>
    Metashell provides an interactive shell similar to the Python, Haskell and
    Erlang shells for template metaprogramming. It uses Clang to evaluate the
    metaprograms.
