<h1>Troubleshooting</h1>

When you are having difficulties with setting up Metashell or you would like to
know more about how it works internally, you can enable logging by starting
Metashell with the `--log -` command line argument. This tells Metashell to
display in the console (in comments) what it is doing in the background (eg.
compiling some code with Clang, searching for standard headers, etc).

To save the logs into a file instead of displaying them in the console, you need
to start Metashell with the `--log <filename>` argument.

If you can't fix things using the logs, please contact the authors of Metashell.
